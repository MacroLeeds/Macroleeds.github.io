Research Aspect
======
In fact, this is the topic of the Institute's internship, but I can't say it's completely irrelevant to my direction, so it's here for the record.

It has been found that firms smooth R&D expenditures by maintaining liquid inventories in the form of cash reserves, and there is empirical evidence that the increase in firms' cash flows in the 1990s drove the increase in R&D during this period. These results suggest that firms hold cash to finance their R&D investments due to financing frictions. With respect to the effect of inflation on firms' cash holdings, studies have provided empirical evidence that inflation has a negative impact on cash holdings because firms "expect cash to depreciate during inflation and therefore tend to reduce their cash holdings." The same literature, using firm-level panel data, suggests that high inflation discourages firms from investing in R&D by reducing their liquidity holdings. (This is the primary mechanism, and is the same thing as the CIA)

As for the Schumpeterian model, the following paper is about a two-country Schumpeterian growthmodel with cash-in-advance constraints on consumption and R&D investment.

Private Whisper

在一些重要的事情上要學會取捨與拒絕，不能心太軟，，，，

靠北，這段研究院的實習如果早點拒絕的話，說不定現在能夠更好地進入學習狀態，然而事實上由於自己的軟心腸，得等到7月中旬才能結束了，，，

目前自己的專業基礎知識感覺還是太過貧乏，幹！

友人說如果我能有百分之一慣她那樣對待自己就好了，笑，沒辦法啦，我太討厭我自己了，i can't beat it, sry

她能接收到我的愛就足夠了（註：友人之愛，性緣腦走開啦）
